# Single-hexagon
- Note that adding height as the highest value of what is doubled in ``` .hexagon ``` will make it into a honeycomb.
- Also note that hexagons have **6** sides with a **60** degree angle, so when using ```rotate``` use **60** degrees as base number.

Example
-----------
```
 width: 600px;
 height: 300px;
 ```
Will make it into a normal hexagon shape. While...

```
width: 300px;
height: 600px;
```
Will change the shape into a honeycomb shape.
